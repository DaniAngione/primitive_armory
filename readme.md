## DESCRIPTION

Primitive Armory is a simple mod that adds a handful of very early game items to create a
small arsenal to give players some interesting choices and possibilities for the gap between
early/starting weapons & armor and the metal age.

The current version of the mod adds shields with no Def bonus (just a small chance to block), 
chest pieces with Def+2, helmets with Def+1 and a small range of weapons with Atk+11
(Carpenter & Potter) plus a couple of Atk+12 and Atk+13 slightly higher level weapons for the
Mason.

The equipment is designed to fit the game's style and colors, using the same palette as
Stonehearth's vanilla wood, ceramics and stone. Primitive Armory can be helpful for more
casual play of Normal mode, giving yourself a bit more of time to proceed to the metal age 
on your own pace - and it is also particularly helpful and interesting for Hard Mode, where
it shines by giving you an edge to focus on other parts of your settlement while still being
able to survive the rapid strengthening of your hearthlings' foes.

## COMPATIBILITY

The mod only adds entities (items) and recipes to pre-existing Stonehearth professions and as
such it should be compatible with any other mods unless they override basic professions and
their recipe lists.

## LOCALIZATION

This mod is completely compatible with Stonehearth's localization, it is in English (en)
by default but also includes a Brazillian Portuguese (pt-BR) translation. 

If you're willing to translate this mod to any other language and would like to see the
localization supported on the official mod itself, contact me on Discord:

## CHANGELOG

# (June 12th, 2018) v1.2
- Fixed female armors to function with the new stonehearth standards.

# (May 13th, 2018) v1.1
- Fixed some typos/text issues
- Changed the Primitive Spear and the Primitive Stone Spear to 1-handed weapons. They were
acting as 1-handed weapons due to a Stonehearth bug that is affecting all 2-handers, but since
it might be fixed at some point, I decided to make the change now.
- Fixed an issue where hearthlings would refuse to get better equipment.
- Removed the parry chance from the Primitive Dagger.

# (May 6th, 2018) v1.0
- Initial release
